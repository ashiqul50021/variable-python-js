// 16-2 What is variable, five things you need to declare a variable
// A Variable is like a container that contains various kinds of data for future uses.
// ● In JavaScript, we have needed five things to declare a variable. They are var (keyword),
// variableName, = (equal sign), a value, and, a ‘;’ (semicolon at the end).
// ● Some example: var price = 21; var age = 24; var temp = 37; etc.

var price = 21;
var age = 24;
var temp = 37;

var name = "John";
var address = "dhaka";
var phone = "0123456789";
var school = "Dhaka International School";

var pass = true;
var fail = false;
